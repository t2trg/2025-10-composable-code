## Composable Code for Things

Smart Things need to run code.
Can we dynamically compose and partially update the code at runtime?
From different authors and provenances, with independent upgrades?
With isolation, so a broken or even malicious component cannot break the rest of the code?
Can the same code be run on different platforms?  “Plug and play”?
What are the common system and communication interfaces that enable that portability?

In a T2TRG interim (online) meeting in October 2025, we look at the
state of the art and explore ways forward to composable code for
things.
